				<p><strong>Goal</strong></p> 
				<p>The aim of the game is to build up four stacks of cards starting with Ace and ending with King, all of the same suit, on one of the four Foundations. If the player succeed, the game is won. If the player can no longer make any meaningful moves, the game is considered lost. At this point, winning is impossible.
                </p> 
                 
				 <p><strong>How to move cards</strong></p> 
				<p>To move a card or sequence of cards, touch and hold on the card or sequence and drag it to the desired position on the Tableau, then release. You can also quickly tap a card or a sequence of cards to move it automatically to the best available position.</p>  
				  
				  <p> &nbsp;</p>
				 <p><strong>Standard mode rules</strong></p> 
				<p>Solitaire is played with a standard 52 card deck without jokers. In a one card game, only one card will be drawn from the Deck pile and placed into the Waste pile at a time, while in a three card game three cards are drawn and upturned in the Waste pile at a time. There are no limits to how many times the Deck pile can be cycled through.
				 </p> 
				  
				  <p>After shuffling, seven piles of cards are laid from left to right, this is called the Tableau. From left to right, each pile contains one more card than the last. The first and left-most pile contains a single upturned card, the second pile contains two cards (one downturned, one upturned), the third contains three (two downturned, one upturned), and so on, until the seventh pile which contains seven cards (six downturned, one upturned). The topmost card of each pile is turned face up. The remaining cards are placed facedown at the upper left of the layout, this is called the Deck.
				  </p>
				  
				   <p>The four Foundations are built by suit, from Ace (low) to King (high). Cards in the Tableau must be arranged in sequences of alternating colors (red to black to red, or black to red to black, and so on), and stacked from high at the top (base) to low at the bottom (for example: red 9, black 8, red 7, black 6). Individual cards and sequences can be moved to different positions in the Tableau to build out sequences until they can be fed into the Foundations by suit. The game is won when all cards are upturned and arranged by suit in the Foundations, stacked from Ace to King.

			<p><strong>Vegas mode rules</strong></p> 
				<p>Vegas mode is very similar to standard mode. Differences are in scoring and in the fact that you can go through the deck a limited number of times : one time if you play with one card, three times if you play with three cards. In this mode you start with a score of -52$. Your goal is to be positive at the end of the game. A game end when all cards are upturned and arranged by suit in the Foundations, stacked from Ace to King, or when there are no more possible moves.

			<p><strong>Vegas cumulative mode rules</strong></p> 
				<p>Vegas cumulative mode is similar to Vegas mode, the only difference is that score will not be cleared and will carry on to the next game. This way, a player can track whether they are “ahead” or “behind” over a streak of games.
